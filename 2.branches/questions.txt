- git branch -a vs git branch --list ?

# Questions:
    1. commit and branch relation?
        - Branch is just a series of corresponding commit and pointer to the last commit. ( branch ~ commit )
        - A branch has many related commit.
        - Git branches are effectively a pointer to a commit(snapshot of your changes).

Q. fetch vs pull:
    - Git Fetch is the command that tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into the local repository.
    - Git Pull on the other hand brings the copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository.

Q. what happen to the branch that we create when we dont do any task on it and switch into some other branch?

Q. while creating any branches, does it matter "on top of what branch we created that particular branches"?
    - yes, base branch of newly created branch.

Q. What will happen to the task/manipulation/updation that we have done, staying in that particular task, if we delete that branch before commiting.
    - so indoder to delete that particular branch you need to switch some other branch first, then the manipulated task is also switched to that branch.


Q. How to see the branch tree in git?
