Your branch is based on 'origin/main', but the upstream is gone.
(use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)

fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
    git push --set-upstream origin main




















1. What is origin in git?
   In Git, "origin" is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from.

2. What is remote repository?
   A remote repository in Git, also called a remote, is a Git repository that's hosted on the Internet or another network.

3. What is the difference between local and remote repository?
   	Local repositories reside on the computers of team members.
	In contrast, remote repositories are hosted on a server that is accessible for all team members.
	Most likely on the internet or on a local network.

4. local repo ==> git repo ==> publish product.

Branching workflow: Long running branches & Topic Branches
Long running branches: master, develop, purpose update, this branch stayes till the end of project.


# git scope: system, global, local

remote: any 
origin: specific
