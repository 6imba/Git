6. It is used for:
    - Track project.
    - Tracking code changes.
    - Tracking who made changes.
    - Coding collaboration.

7. GIt workflow:
    - WorkingLocalDirectory ==> StagingArea ==> LocalRepository ==> RemoteRepository

        > WorkingLocalDirectory:                                     |
            - add(track/stage), reset(unstage), rm(untrack)          |
                > StagingArea: stash, diff                           |
                    - commit, reset(undo commit)                     |
                        > LocalRepository: merge                     |
                            - push|fetch                            pull
                                > RemoteRepository                  _|_
                                    => publish product.

	- # untrack  = file has not sent to staging area(when file is created for the first time)
	- # unstaged = file has been sent to staging area but new changes are not added to staging area.
    > git add <filename>
    > git add *
    - git add ==> choose a file that you want to take in staging area.( staging area files are the files that you want commit to your local repo)

1. What is origin in git?
   In Git, "origin" is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from.

2. What is remote repository?
   A remote repository in Git, also called a remote, is a Git repository that's hosted on the Internet or another network.

3. What is the difference between local and remote repository?
   	Local repositories reside on the computers of team members.
