5. Git : Distributed Version Control System.

6. It is used for:
    - Track project.
    - Tracking code changes.
    - Tracking who made changes.
    - Coding collaboration.

7. WorkingLocalDirectory ==> StagingArea ==> LocalRepository
    - WorkingLocalDirectory ==add(track|stage)==> StagingArea ==commit==> LocalRepository

	- # untrack  = file has not sent to staging area(when file is created for the first time)
	- # unstaged = file has been sent to staging area but new changes are not added to staging area.
    > git add <filename>
    > git add *

# Main-Concept:
    - WorkingLocalDirectory ==add(track|stage)==> StagingArea ==commit==> LocalRepository ==(push|pull)==> RemoteRepository ====> publish product.
